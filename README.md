- 🍄 My main languages are currently Python and SQL, but I'm also pretty familiar with C, Rust, and Swift!
<!-- - 🪷 I'm currently learning Java, C++, and Go! -->
- 🐝 My primary interest is likely something related to data! I like tinkering around with databases and also predictive modelling :D
- 🔭 My philosophy research is mainly about the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and consciousness. Sometimes I bring up neural networks to sound fancy XD
